# Final-Project-Group6 - Natural Language Processing Coursework

Topic: Chatbot for Intent Recognition

Purpose of the project : The focus of this project is to build a Chatbot for Intent Recognition using Transformer algorithms like BERT, Distilled BERT and LSTM. The purpose of the Chatbot is to recognize the intent of the user input and give the response back to the user on the basis of the intent. The data modelling will be interfaced through a UI using tkinter and the pipeline will be integrated using AWS EC2 instance.
